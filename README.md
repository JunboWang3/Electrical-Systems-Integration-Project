# Electrical-Systems-Integration-Project
Focused on programming the Jetson Nano and ROS for the McMaster AEV's electric propulsion system, and explored autonomous driving techniques like LiDAR-based navigation and collision avoidance.

The first part of the project was from mastering basic Linux commands to the operation of electronic speed controllers and autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) components. First, I mastered the Linux commands necessary to program the Jetson Nano. Then, working in groups, set up udev rules to manage device permissions for components such as VESC, lidar, and cameras on the Jetson Nano. We install and configure VESC software, ensure proper motor operation and safety parameters, and use VESC tools for real-time data analysis.

In the second part, we will integrate various AEV components on ROS system and set up a simulation environment using the F1tenth simulator for pre-experimental testing. Additionally, we covered manually controlling the AEV using a joystick, adjusting the vehicle odometer, and conducting experiments with data from sensors such as lidar and cameras integrated into the AEV system. Ultimately, we achieve a comprehensive understanding and practical application of system integration and data processing in an autonomous vehicle environment.
